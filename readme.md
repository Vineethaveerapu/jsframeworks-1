- Create a webserver
- Create a home page
- Create content for at least 4 routes
- At least two routes must render html directly
- At least two routes must display content that comes from an external file (eg txt or html)
- Read at least two queries passed in the url
- Generate different content based on the queries
- The content for the queries should be stored in external files

For ease of assessment, I strongly recommend adding instructions on how to access your routes and queries to the home page. I need to know where I'm supposed to go!
